## History

The Poppy project was born in 2012 in the [Flowers laboratory](https://flowers.inria.fr/) at [Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/bordeaux). It was initiated during [Matthieu Lapeyre](https://github.com/matthieu-lapeyre)'s PhD Thesis surpervised by [Pierre-Yves Oudeyer](http://www.pyoudeyer.com/).

At the beginning, the development team was composed by Matthieu Lapeyre (mechanics &amp; design), [Pierre Rouanet](https://github.com/pierre-rouanet) (software) and Jonathan Grizou (electronics).

This project is initially a fundamental research project financed by [ERC Grant Explorer](http://erc.europa.eu/) to explore the role of embodiment and morphology properties on cognition and especially on the learning of sensori-motor tasks.

## Philosophy

The Poppy project is a **community-centered** robotic project. It targets the needs of a multidisciplinary community where researchers, teachers, artists, and robotic enthusiasts can share their work and ideas.

Poppy tools are designed to be modular, easy to use, and easy to integrate – providing a set of building blocks that can be easily assembled and reconfigured.

Poppy places the people creativity and bottom-up project emergence at the heart of the robotic development.

Through its accessibility and its openness, the Poppy project contributes to make future technologies more democratic and transparent.

## Contribution

If you want to take part in the Poppy project, the first step is to become a member of the community on the [forum](https://forum.poppy-project.org). It is a central place in the exchanges between users and contributors, where everyone is free to come talk about their projects and ideas.

There are many ways to contribute as the Poppy project involves a wide range of disciplines:

- Engineering fields such as computer science, mechanics, electronics, machine learning...
- Humanities such as cognitive science, psychology...
- Life science such as biology, biomechanics...
- Community management, scientific mediation, communication...
- Art, animation, design...

If you would like to contribute, you are very much welcome. Apart from sharing your own project, you can take a look at the project [source code](https://github.com/poppy-project/) and [call for contributions](https://forum.poppy-project.org/tags/call-for-contributions).

Advanced users can of course create issues to notify a problem or develop new features that can be integrated to the project.
