## History

The Poppy project was born in 2012 in the [Flowers laboratory](https://flowers.inria.fr/) at [Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/bordeaux). It started during [Matthieu Lapeyre](https://github.com/matthieu-lapeyre)'s PhD Thesis while supervised by [Pierre-Yves Oudeyer](http://www.pyoudeyer.com/).

At the beginning, the development team was composed of Matthieu Lapeyre (mechanics &amp; design), [Pierre Rouanet](https://github.com/pierre-rouanet) (software) and [Jonathan Grizou](http://jgrizou.com/) (electronics).

This project was initially a fundamental research project financed by [ERC Grant Explorer](http://erc.europa.eu/) to explore the role of embodiment and morphology properties on cognition and especially on the learning of sensori-motor tasks.

## Philosophy

The Poppy project is a **community-centered** robotic project. It targets the needs of a multidisciplinary community where researchers, teachers, artists, and robotic enthusiasts can share their work and ideas.

Poppy tools are designed to be modular, easy to use, and easy to integrate â€“ providing a set of building blocks that can be easily assembled and reconfigured.

Poppy puts people creativity and bottom-up project emergence at the heart of the robotic development.

Through its accessibility and its openness, the Poppy project contributes to make future technologies more democratic and transparent.

## Contribution

If you want to take part in the Poppy project, the first step is to become a member of the community on the [forum](https://forum.poppy-project.org). It is a central place to exchange between users and contributors, where everyone is free to talk about their projects and ideas.

There are many ways to contribute as the Poppy project involves a wide range of disciplines:

- Engineering fields such as computer science, mechanics, electronics, machine learning...
- Humanities such as cognitive science, psychology...
- Life science such as biology, biomechanics...
- Community management, scientific mediation, communication...
- Art, animation, design...

If you would like to contribute, you are very much welcome. Apart from sharing your own project, you can take a look at the project [source code](https://github.com/poppy-project/) and [call for contributions](https://forum.poppy-project.org/tags/call-for-contributions).

Users are encouraged to notify any problem they encounter or develop new features to be integrated to the project.
