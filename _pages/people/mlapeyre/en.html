      <strong>Matthieu Lapeyre</strong> graduated from the École Normale Supérieure de Cachan (mechanical specialty) and Doctor of the University of Bordeaux.
      <br/>
      He joined Flowers INRIA team in 2010 for his internship Master 2 and began a thesis on <strong>the role of the body</strong> in the acquisition of bipedal walking.
      <br/>
      In his thesis, Matthieu was faced with techno-scientific difficulties of <strong>experimental robotics</strong> and societal issues of <strong>open science</strong>. He saw an opportunity to provide an innovative response and was able to pivot in its path to develop <strong>the first complete humanoid robot open source and printed in 3D</strong>. Thus, his thesis entitled <strong>"Poppy: Open source 3D printed humanoid robot and modular for Science, Art and Education (2014)"</strong> is the origin of the Poppy community and was rewarded with a <strong>2nd thesis prize of the "GDR Robotique"</strong>.
      <br/>
      Its multi-disciplinary expertise allow it to design very quickly complex and innovative technology integrations with a <strong>fine design</strong>, distinguishing itself from other technology projects.
      <br/>
      With almost <strong>6 years of experience in the field of robotics</strong>, it has a clear vision of the technological challenges and scientific limitations of a growing field. His involvement in scientific projects and its central role in the Poppy network allowed it to be recognized and to develop privileged contacts with scientific actors, associations and territorial policy.
      Beyond robotics, it is very invested in the development of new models of social and economic development which FabLabs, crowdfunding and open source are parties.
