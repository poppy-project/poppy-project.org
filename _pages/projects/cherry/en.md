## Project

<p class="lead tc">
  The Cherry project is a community project to develop scenarios regarding breaking isolation of children at the hospital.
</p>

Cherry uses Poppy Torso robot as a companion for hospitalized children in primary school. Cherry can compensate a social rupture during hospitalization. It mediates between the child, his friends, his family and teachers and can talk to him or play some games.

It also acts on a pedagogical level, to encourage the child to interact with the school, by offering quizzes and educational games.

One last prospect is to assist the hospital staff in the therapeutic education. Indeed, sometimes a message is more acceptable by the child if it is issued by the robot rather than an adult dressed as a physician.
