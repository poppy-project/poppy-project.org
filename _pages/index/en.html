      We think that robotics will fundamentally change the way we interact with everyday objects and how they interact with us. We want to put the people in the center of this revolution, where objects become alive, so they can unleash their creativity and are capable of understanding and shaping this robotic new world.

    We think it is just a matter of genuine collaborations between people from various background and culture who bring their very own sensibility. We enable those collaborations by creating open technologies and communities in a unique way: <strong> building elegant, innovative and simple products that bring a unique experience and unleash people creativity</strong>.
