    <p class="lead tc">
      With Poppy you can program robotics objects without needing to build the complete robot design beforehand.
      A wide range of possible educational activities including secondary school, higher education,
      various options and subjects can benefit from this tool.

      The platform accessibility enables teachers to create and to share educational and collaborative projects that meet two key characteristics:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Integration of <strong>various technologies and methodologies</strong>: 3D printing, programming, electronics, machine learning algorithms.</li>
      <li>Connections and <strong>collaborations between different disciplines</strong>: engineering, science, design, humanities, art.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Poppy Education aims to create, evaluate and disseminate all-inclusive pedagogical kits, open-source and low cost, for teaching computer science and robotics.
