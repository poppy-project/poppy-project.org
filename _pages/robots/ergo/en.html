    <p class="tc">
      Originally designed in the <a href="https://flowers.inria.fr/robots/ergo-robots/">"Mathematics: a beautiful elsewhere"</a> artistic experiment, the Ergo Jr has been adapted to fit with education needs.
    </p>
    <p class="tc">
      It is a robotic arm, consisting of 6 motors allowing life-like movements and 3D printed elements. The use of rivets make the assembly, modification and reassembly easy. Ergo Jr comes with three tools for different interactions with its environment: a lampshade, a gripper and a pen holder.
    </p>
    <p class="tc">
      The robot is controlled with a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a> board, and a camera helps it interact with the world.
    </p>
    <p class="tc">
      Everything in the robot is let transparent and accessible to promote an educative approach and an interactive technology.

    <h2>Program Ergo Jr</h2>
    <p>
      Ergo Jr relies on <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu">Snap!</a>, a variant of <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>, the visual programming language. Its accessibility and efficiency make it a great tool to discover robotics and understand the digital world. It can be used directly on the robot with no additional installation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It comes with a set of pedagogical activities, developed with high-school teachers, ranging from the discovery of the robot and how to control it to more complex and integrated project. These activities are accessible for free on <a href="https://forum.poppy-project.org/tags/c/education/pedagogical-activities/ergo-jr">the project's forums</a>.
