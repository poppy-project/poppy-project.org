      Poppy Torso is a variation of the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/en/robots/poppy-humanoid">Poppy Humanoid</a> robot. It is an open-source humanoid robot torso which can be installed easily on tabletops. More affordable than the Poppy Humanoid, it is an ideal medium to learn science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
    </p>
    <p class="tc">
      Like Poppy Humanoid, Poppy Torso is an open-source robot (both hardware and software), using 3D printed parts and Dynamixel servomotors, known for their reliability.
    </p>
    <p class="tc">
      The robot is attached to a suction pad with lever arm to ensure the utmost stability. The suction pad and the fastening nuts are included in the kit.

    <h3>Student project example</h3>

    <p>
      Beyond learning programming and mechatronics, Poppy Torso can be used in learning to design human-machine interaction, such as in assistive robotics projects. The <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.lang }}/projects/cherry">Cherry Project</a> is such a successful example, where a group of students explored how to use Poppy Torso to assist children in hospitals.
